Week 06 things seem to be making more sense and somehow everything just seemed to have pieced together.

I've really enjoyed using React and using it has solidified a lot of what we were doing in previous weeks, the way React works has somehow helped my understanding of some the concepts better.

I was pretty excited to use React from the beginning with it's nice user functionalities and how much more efficient it seems to get an idea running quickly. I feel way more in flow using React.

I've found linking pages and components at first a little tricky and knowing what order to place things but this is also something I feel is getting easier with repetition and understanding. 

The roadblocks this week have been nothing compared to the last couple and I wasn't running into so many problems that caused massively delays in delivering the work. I think the combination of a fresh approach, coding language and last weeks stresses has meant this week was pretty smooth sailing and I think I can see a significant improvement in my speed and understanding. I still need to keep going over certain concpets as I'd like to feel more confident with the areas I don't feel as astute in but beleieve with time and repetition the thinking part will become second nature.
